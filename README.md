# GetAndCleanDataProject

This project aims at getting data from an online source and cleaning the data set. 

The run_analysis.R script does the following tasks:
<li> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
<li> Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
<li> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
<li> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
<li> From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
